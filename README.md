Portfolio optimization refers to the building of choice of investment assets, which will provide the best possible risk-return relationship. The Markowitz strategy, which was imagined by Harry Markowitz in 1952, stands as a landmark for the portfolio theory through the addition of diversification as means to diminish risk. This task investigates different aspects of the Markowitz model, such as defining optimum portfolio for different targeted returns, enabling savings devoid of investment, creating minimum expected return, and permitting short selling. By undertaking these assignments, we do make distinguishing the theoretical aspects of portfolio optimization and their practical application in investment decisions.

Indeed, the efficient frontier chart shows upward curves, which means that the expected return and risk go in hand with each other. This undertaking presents an opportunity to explore and operationalize the Markowitz model that can be used for developing a diversified set of
portfolios. It is built on the theory with no regulations for short selling or money on the side, which can be vague to real-life investment scenarios.

The efficiency frontier graph display a more raged shape in instead compared to their previous tasks and this is to show the fact that we can now choose how to construct the portfolio to get the best profit
Short selling carries an additional form of risk overlay that unveils more rigorous way of risk management and portfolio diversification, allowing investors to capitalize upon market inefficiencies and boost portfolio results. Although it has new challenges, such as positions loss, and the margin calls, it continues to be an important method of speculation. Task 4 portrays what short selling involves through presenting its limitations and how it finally can modify the portfolio risk and gain.

# Conclusion

In the light of this, the Markowitz approach to portfolios optimization using a combination of risk and return ratio as the principle enables investors to be confident of yields through diversification. This assignment has brought us to different sides of portfolio optimization, such as setting target returns, limiting the investment availability, and the overall procedure of short selling. Employing the Malkowitz model becomes a good practice to use as small investors obtain much beneficial information on the construction of portfolios intended to achieve particular aims with appropriate risk levels. In general, this project covers both the richness and the usefulness of the portfolio optimization techniques which is not only applicable in the situations of increased market instability and complexity but also sought-after for high returns.
